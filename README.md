Deep Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) otherwise known as DeepDOM is the name for a cruise (deployment KN210-04, https://www.bco-dmo.org/deployment/59057) that was conducted across the Western Atlantic Ocean (starting at Montevideo, Uruguay and ending at Bridgetown, Barbados) in 2013.

The science objectives of this cruise included:
1. Characterizing deep ocean dissolved organic matter in water masses of western Atlantic Ocean.
2. Characterizing microbial community at selected stations and at selected depths.
3. Characterizing metabolic capabilities of surface, mesopelagic and bathypelagic microbial consortia vis-a-vis the degradation of organic matter from each zone.
4. Examining metabolic and phylogenetic links between microbes in different marine zones (surface, meso-pelagic and bathypelagic depths).

Seawater samples were collected using the following methods to investigate the science objectives shown above:
1. Collecting discrete water samples using Niskin-bottles.
2. Collecting microbial communities from these water samples, by in-situ pumping, or by net-traps and net-tows.
3. Conducting incubation experiments in lab and on deck.
4. Conducting mass spectrometry and flow cytometry underway, using the vessel's seawater intake.

The purpose of this wiki is to provide links to all the relevant metadata and data files in one location to aid training, exploration, and integration efforts during the C-CoMP DeepDOM Workshop. Datasets using various methods are presented below:

## DeepDOM Metaproteomes





## Intracellular Metabolites in Marine Microorganisms during an Experiment Evaluating Microbial Mortality

Paper:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7142611/ (Longnecker and Kujawinski, 2020). 

Study description (from MetaboLights): This project considers the effects of predation and viral lysis on the metabolites found in the surface ocean. Using seawater from the surface ocean, we experimentally manipulated levels of predation and viral lysis. At the beginning and end of the experiment, we sampled the intracellular and extracellular metabolites. The extracts were analyzed using liquid chromatography-based targeted and untargeted metabolomics methods that we have modified for use with marine samples. Lead PI: Liz Kujawinski, Co-PI: Krista Longnecker
